          A good paragraph is composed of a topic sentence (or key sentence),
          relevant supporting sentences, and a closing (or transition) sentence.
          This structure is key to keeping your paragraph focused on the main
          idea and creating a clear and concise image. While creative writing
          does not necessarily follow the traditional paragraph structure, itâ€™s
          more about scene building and continuing a narrative. Efficient,
          well-written paragraphs are a staple of good flash fiction and short
          fiction writing, as short stories need to stay more focused on a
          central idea. As long as your sentences form cohesive ideas and
          connect to one another, you can write a good paragraph.
